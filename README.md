#### 1. How does Spring Batch Work?

* Spring batch, a batch processing solution for the Spring platform, helps in developing the batching processing applications in a more modular and predictable way.
* Batch processing can be applied to different kinds of applications such as loading records from a comma-separated value (CSV) file into a database, nontrivial processing on records in a database, or even resizing images on the file system whose metadata is stored in a database.
